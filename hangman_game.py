Program title: HangShelly
Program description: This is a game of Hangman, but I called it "HangShelly" so it can be Madeira themed.

This is where you talk about...
- problems you faced and how you solved them
    +My biggest problem was trying to make a list with the letters that were incorrectly guessed so I could show them to the player. I had to do "if player input is not in the word and not in the incorrect guess list, append the playerinput into the incorrect guessed list"
    +I had trouble figuring out how to print the hangmans, but I used a list of lists (before you mentioned it in class)
        I also had to associate the letters_not_guessed scoer to the hangmans so I could just say hangmans[letters_not_guessed] instead of a bunch of if statements
    + For the underscores, I had to research and found out I can use len() and join() to replace the certain place with the player_input if it was in the word
    + I fixed the restart function by setting it up like the error_handling function and creating a list y_or_n

- what you're proud of
    - I'm proud of having the patience to do this
    - Making a funner game than blackjack
    - struggling less on this than the first PA1 because I learnt a lot since then
    - fixing the restart function because I struggled on that 
    - fixing the thigns I struggled on above

- what you'd change or add if you had more time
    + I would make the option after like 3 guesses to guess the word
    + I would do different levels of difficulty for the words (probably with a list of lists)
        I would do like guessing something with two words like "strawberries and cream"
    + I would create a dictionary so each word could be assigned a hint, because it is really hard right now to guess a word with all the different categories
    + I would use try except / find a way to because I didn't really know where to put it
    + I would work more on the error_handling. currently, it works, but not the way I want it to so when you don't type in a letter it
    prints the "Your answer:" but also prints the orignal input in main "Guess a letter:" so, the user would have to type the letter twice
